Description: Git CLI extension for mini-commit workflow
git-mini-commit is a Git CLI extension that introduces "mini-commit" as an
intermediate unit between the staging area and regular commits, making it
easier to manage diffs during large-scale refactoring or change work.
.
Mini-commits are managed locally and do not affect Git's push/fetch operations.
You can organize and review diffs in the staging area, and integrate multiple
mini-commits into regular commits.
